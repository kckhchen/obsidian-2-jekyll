Make your Obsidian articles Jekyll-ready.

This is a tool build with python that scans your obsidian folder, formats your articles to make them compatible with Jekyll's requirements, and saves them to your Jekyll project folder, waiting to be published, so you can keep your articles clean, while Jekyll gets its preferred flavor.

## Features

- Auto-generates frontmatters with all the essentials.
- Converts your `h1` header to your post title.
- Copies used images to Jekyll assets folder and update `![[img]]` links.
- Converts `[[Wikilinks]]` to standard Markdown links.
- `$Math$` / `Code` / `> [!Callout]` / `[[#^Internal-link]]` support.
- Syncs to your vault; removed posts get deleted on you Jekyll site too.
- Your original Obsidian article remains intact, the way you want it to be.

> [!warning]
> To display callouts, the tool will add a `obsidian-callouts.html` in your Jekyll project's `_includes` folder. You can modify how you want callouts to look there.

```

### Run the Tool

#### 1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kckhchen/obsidian-2-jekyll.git
cd obsidian-2-jekyll
```

#### 2. Configure `config.py` to locate your vault:


| Variable              | Description                                 | Example                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `SOURCE_DIR`          | A folder in your vault for publication      | `/Users/me/Obsidian/Publish` |
| `JEKYLL_DIR`          | Your Jekyll project folder                  | `/Users/me/Jekyll`           |
| `IMG_FOLDER`          | Image folder in your Jekyll project folder  | `assets/images`              |

```python
# config.py
SOURCE_DIR = "/Users/me/Obsidian/Publish"  # Path to Your Post Folder
JEKYLL_DIR = "/Users/me/Jekyll"            # Your Site
IMG_FOLDER = "assets/images"               # Relative to Jekyll Root
```

## Heads-Up

This tool has not been widely tested in many different scenarios, but all my [personal blog posts](https://kckhchen.com/blog/) (in Mandarin Chinese) are generated by this tool. Generally this tool is safe to use since your original Obsidian posts won't be touched. However, if you notice some quirks in display on your Jekyll site please don't hesitate to contact me. Any suggestions are welcome.
